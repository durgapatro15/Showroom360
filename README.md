## Overview
Showroom360 is a comprehensive Java-based system designed to streamline showroom management. Leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, it provides a modular structure for handling key showroom entities such as vehicles, customers, and orders. With support for data persistence via file handling or database integration, the system ensures smooth and efficient management of inventory, sales, and customer interactions while offering scalability and maintainability.
## Project Desceiption
Showroom360 is a Java-based management solution designed to optimize the day-to-day operations of a showroom. Built with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, the system organizes core entities like vehicles, customers, orders, and employees into distinct, modular classes, making the code easy to manage and extend. The system supports both file handling and database integration (MySQL, SQLite) for data persistence, allowing it to scale from small, single-showroom setups to larger multi-showroom operations.
