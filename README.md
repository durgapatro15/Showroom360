## Project Desceiption
Showroom360 is a Java-based management solution designed to optimize the day-to-day operations of a showroom. Built with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, the system organizes core entities like vehicles, customers, orders, and employees into distinct, modular classes, making the code easy to manage and extend. The system supports both file handling and database integration (MySQL, SQLite) for data persistence, allowing it to scale from small, single-showroom setups to larger multi-showroom operations.

Key features include user management, inventory tracking, and order processing, which help streamline workflows and improve customer interactions. The system also provides search and filtering options for quick vehicle lookup, reporting and analytics for business insights, and robust error handling for a seamless user experience. With its scalable and maintainable structure, Showroom360 is designed to meet the evolving needs of modern showrooms.
