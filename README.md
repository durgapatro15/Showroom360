## Overview
Showroom360 is a Java-based Showroom Management System built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.The system provides an efficient way to manage various showroom entities like vehicles, customers, and orders.
## Project Desceiption
Modular Design: The system is designed with modular class structures, ensuring scalability and maintainability. Each class represents a core entity in the showroom (e.g., Vehicle, Customer, Order), making it easier to manage and extend functionality.
OOP Principles: Implements key OOP concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction, leading to clean, organized, and reusable code.
Data Persistence: The system supports persistent storage using either file handling (for simpler data storage) or database integration for larger-scale data management. This ensures data is retained across sessions.
